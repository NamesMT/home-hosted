# Upgrading

Per-version migration notes, lifted into the GitHub release body by `scripts/release-notes.mjs`.
A section here is what a person reads when they upgrade — the CHANGELOG lists commits, not what to
do about them.

Keep each entry to what someone must *change*, not what was added. If a release has nothing a person
must act on, it needs no section here at all.

The script reads only the section for the version being released, so a section is deleted once that
version ships: its text lives on in that GitHub release's body.
